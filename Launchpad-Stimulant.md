# Launchpad Exhibit by Stimulant Design

# What Is It?
The exhibit investigates Seattleâ€™s history as a key center for innovation, and MOHAI wanted an installation that would act as a coda to the experience, inspiring visitors to be innovative in their own lives and communities.
They designed an experience that literally reflected the user in the exhibit, underscoring that anyone can be innovative if they simply cultivate certain habits of mind.

# What Are The Sub-Components?
- Multi-Touch Interactive Mirror
- Depth-Sensor Cameras
- One Sided Mirror Wall
- Projector
- Motion Sensor
- TUIO ReacTIVision (I'm guessing this is what they used to make it interactive because they were able to make it into a touchscreen. We used a similar platform for doing the interactive table in our Objects & Spaces Class.)
