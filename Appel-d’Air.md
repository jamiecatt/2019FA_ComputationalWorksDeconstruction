# Appel d’Air

# What Is It?
Appel d’Air is an installation providing its audience the opportunity to interact with wind.
By blowing on a tiny paper windmill, users trigger an industrial fan. The wind’s response is proportional in both duration and intensity to the input it received from the person who started the conversation.

This installation was first shown during “Bain De Midi”, a group exhibition for kids between 2 and 4 years old which was held from December 7th to 23rd 2012 in Stéréolux, Nantes (France).
